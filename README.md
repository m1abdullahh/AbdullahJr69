- 👋 Hi, I’m @AbdullahJr69
- 👀 Interests consist of mainly backend development using JavaScript ❤️, Cross-Platform app developing using Flutter 💞, and sometimes, Web App designing gets me as well. 😁
- 🌱 NodeJS is the king and always will be. (Looking at you, Deno 🧐), also, Bun is good, too.
- 💞️ Back-end development is sometimes more enjoying than front-end.
- 🍃 MongoDB is the (document-based) database choice.
- 🤯 I love(eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee) to learn new things development.
